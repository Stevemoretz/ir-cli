Cesar then married Calpurnia. Her contemporaries describe Calpurnia as a humble, often shy woman.
By all accounts Calpurnia was a faithful and virtuous wife, and seems to have tolerated Cesar's affairs:
he was rumored to have seduced the wives of a number of prominent men, including both of his allies in the First Triumvirate;
and he had for some time been intimate with Servilia, a relationship that was an open secret at Rome.
It was rumored that Cesar was the father of Servilia's son, Marcus Junius Brutus, although this is improbable on chronological grounds, and that Servilia attempted to interest Cesar in her daughter, Junia Tertiaâ€”who according to other rumors, was also Cesar's daughter.
